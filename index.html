    <p>Hi! I am a second-year student at the <a href="#">University of Chicago</a>.</p>
    <p>Previously, I spent four wonderful years at Higher School of Economics studying Economics and Computer Science. There I had the absolute pleasure to work with <a href="#">Nikolay Pilnik</a>, working on Dynamic Optimization problems
    <p>Here is my (mostly-up-to-date) <a href="https://github.com/sstikhonov/sstikhonov.github.io/blob/main/CV_PhD.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
    <p>The best way to reach me is my email: tikhonov at uchicago dot edu</p>
    <p>I worked on Probabilistic Graphical Models at the <a href="https://stat.uchicago.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> and on the applications of non-parametric statistics at <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/academic-areas/econometrics-and-statistics">Booth Business School</a>.</p>
    <p>I also actively worked on the applications of Numerical Analysis to solving Partial Differential Equations in <a href="https://optiver.com/">Optiver</a></p>
